WELCOME ALL
I have created a Memory Matching Game as a Task 
I have completely created the Game using HTML,Tailwindcss and javascript
HTML - is used to create the elements like div, para etc..
TAILWINDCSS - is used to style the elements created in html/i have used class and id selectors to select the elements and style.
JS - is used to create some elements and functions to make the Game interactive and elegent
PAGE 01 :
Page 01 consist of 3 elements
ELEMENT 01 - a title "welcome to memory matching game"
ELEMENT 02 - a image or logo of the page that represents the game 
ELEMENT 03 - consist a button displaying "play game" 
If you click that button PAGE 02 (THE MAIN GAME PAGE) will be displayed
It is achived by creating a function in js and adding eventlistner "click" to it

PAGE 02 :
PAGE 02 consist of 3 elements
ELEMENT 01 - a title or logo on left and a restart button on right
RESTART BTN - when clicked the cards will be reshuffled and game will restart
ELEMENT 02 - a div that consist of the cards (16 cards) that has the front and back side
GAME EXPLAINED :
click on each card to display the image if 2 selected image is similar that a empty card will be displayed to indicate that the match is found
if the 2 images selected is not similar that it will flip again to display the front side
ELEMENT 03 - a div that contains the score obtained.

all this is achieved by creating functions - generate(), flipCard(), checkMatch(), Restart()
